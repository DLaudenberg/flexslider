# FlexSlider for Contao 4+ CMS 
An interface between FlexSlider by WooCommerce and Contao CMS.

## Usage
Configure a Content Element at the article level, or a module at the theme level to display FlexSlider.
Install FlexSlider from GitHub via FlexSlider menu in the backend.

## Note!
This module does not contain FlexSlider, if you would like to use a specific or customized version place them inside of "files/flexslider" of the contao install. Alternatively this module can install the most recent version of FlexSlider from GitHub for you. To do so click "Install FlexSlider" on the top bar of the FlexSlider backend module.
